_Cat and Mouse_ is the second title in the _Danzig Triology_, and my
first, by G&uuml;nter Grass.

Set in Danzig during the Second World War, it is narrated by Pilenz,
who is asserts that the story is about the "Great Mahlke", a friend
from his youth, and not at all about himself. And though indeed the
novella is a recount of the parculiarities and exploits of Mahlke,
that assertion itself, and the encompassing shadow of the narrator's
struggling conscience throughout, suggests that this is more than just
a record of an enigma. The effort of the retelling is part of Pilenz's
attempt at exorcising, or least reaching some sort of peace with the
ghost of Mahlke, something that is not fully revealed until the end.

When the story starts Pilenz and Mahlke are barely in their teens, it
traces through the next couple of years, ending after Mahlke has
already spent some time in the army and as Pilenz is about to join as
a conscript. Pilenz is try to reconstruct for the reader and himself
his relationship with Mahlke. He is setting the background to the
moral dilemma that his is faced with at the end of the story: Mahlke
has gone AWOL and has asked Pilenz to hide him.

Pilnez, as narrator, is often contradictory and uncertain -- he cannot
even make up his mind as to whether he was Mahlke's friend or not. But
I suppose we are to understand that to be a symptom of the
difficulty he is having trying to determine how much responsibility
he must/can/would shoulder for the disappearance of Mahlke.

In the end, this is one of those books which leaves me begging "What
the heck was that about?" Notwithstanding the above, I still do not
know what to make of the book or what I am to take from it.

I should mention I thought the writting good -- I was left charmed by
the first couple of lines:

> ...And one day, after Mahlke had learned to swim, we were lying in
> the grass, in the Schlagball field. I ought to have gone to the
> dentist, but they wouldn't let me because I was hard to replace on
> the team. My tooth was howling. A cat sauntered diagonally across
> the field and no one threw anything at it. A few of the boys were
> chewing or plucking at blades of grass. The cat belonged to the
> caretaker and was black. Hotten Sonntag rubbed his bat with a
> woollen stocking. My tooth marked time.
