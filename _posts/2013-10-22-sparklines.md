Inspired by Tufte's
[sparklines](http://www.edwardtufte.com/bboard/q-and-a-fetch-msg?msg_id=0001OR)
I prototyped the following data visualisation at work today. A
definition of sparklines given by Tutfe:

> A sparkline is a small intense, simple, word-sized graphic with
> typographic resolution. Sparklines mean that graphics are no
> longer cartoonish special occasions with captions and boxes, but
> rather sparkline graphic can be everywhere a word or number can
> be: embedded in a sentence, table, headline, map, spreadsheet,
> graphic.

The [Yale Toolkit](http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/YaleToolkit/)
on CRAN provides an implementaion of sparklines, but since it is not
easy for me to retrive and install packages at work, I thought I'd
roll my own (thanks to KM for the discussion on some of the visual
aspects). Although not quite word-size ...

_R code for this image on
[Github](https://github.com/mngu2382/mngu2382.github.io/blob/master/extras/sparklines/sparklines.R)
and [pdf]({{ site.baseurl}}/images/sparklines.pdf) version of the image
is also available._

__NB__: The data from work has been replaced with publically available
series from the [RBA](http://www.rba.gov.au/statistics/by-subject.html)
and [IndexMundi](http://www.indexmundi.com/commodities/).

The last element that was add to the graphic was the gray background
on the  plots which made an enormous amount of difference, surprising
the crap out of me. I knew it would make a difference -- helping to
visually group elements and graph reading in general -- but the
improvement still surprised.
