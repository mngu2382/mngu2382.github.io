      <h1>Sparklines</h1>
<p>Oct 22, 2013</p>

<article><p>Inspired by Tufte’s
<a href="http://www.edwardtufte.com/bboard/q-and-a-fetch-msg?msg_id=0001OR">sparklines</a>
I prototyped the following data visualisation at work today. A
definition of sparklines given by Tutfe:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>A sparkline is a small intense, simple, word-sized graphic with
typographic resolution. Sparklines mean that graphics are no
longer cartoonish special occasions with captions and boxes, but
rather sparkline graphic can be everywhere a word or number can
be: embedded in a sentence, table, headline, map, spreadsheet,
graphic.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The <a href="http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/YaleToolkit/">Yale Toolkit</a>
on CRAN provides an implementaion of sparklines, but since it is not
easy for me to retrive and install packages at work, I thought I’d
roll my own (thanks to KM for the discussion on some of the visual
aspects). Although not quite word-size …</p>

<p><em>R code for this image on
<a href="https://github.com/mngu2382/mngu2382.github.io/blob/src/extra/sparklines/sparklines.R">Github</a>. A
<a href="/images/sparklines.pdf">pdf</a> version of the image is
also available.</em></p>

<p><strong>NB</strong>: The data from work has been replaced with publically available
series from the <a href="http://www.rba.gov.au/statistics/by-subject.html">RBA</a>
and <a href="http://www.indexmundi.com/commodities/">IndexMundi</a>.</p>

<p>The last element that was add to the graphic was the gray background
on the  plots which made an enormous amount of difference, surprising
the crap out of me. I knew it would make a difference – helping to
visually group elements and graph reading in general – but the
improvement still surprised.</p>
