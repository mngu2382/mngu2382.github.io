_Cat and Mouse_ is the second title in the _Danzig Triology_, and my
first, by G&uuml;nter Grass.

Set in Danzig during the Second World War, it is narrated by Pilenz,
who is adament that the story is about the "Great Mahlke", a friend
from his youth, and not at all about himself. And though indeed the
novella is a recount of the parculiarities and exploits of Mahlke,
that assertion itself, and the encompassing shadow of the narrator's
struggling conscience throughout, suggests that this is more than just
a record of an enigma. The effort of the retelling is part of Pilenz's
attempt at exorcising, or least reaching some sort of peace with the
ghost of Mahlke, something that is not fully revealed until the end.

This is one of those books which leaves me begging "What the heck was
that about?" For what is left is not a dose of catharsis, but an
impression of the Pilnez's mind as it has come through what has just
been related. And a fuzzy impression it is -- Pilnez, as narrator, is
often contradictory and uncertain, but I understand that to be a
symptom of the difficulty he is having trying to determine how much
responsibility he must/can/would shoulder for the disappearance of
Mahlke.

The writting is good -- I was left charmed by the first couple of
sentences:

> ...And one day, after Mahlke had learned to swim, we were lying in
> the grass, in the Schlagball field. I ought to have gone to the
> dentist, but they wouldn't let me because I was hard to replace on
> the team. My tooth was howling. A cat sauntered diagonally across
> the field and no one threw anything at it. A few of the boys were
> chewing or plucking at blades of grass. The cat belonged to the
> caretaker and was black. Hotten Sonntag rubbed his bat with a
> woollen stocking. My tooth marked time.
